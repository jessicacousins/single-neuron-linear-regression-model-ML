# Single Neuron Linear Regression Model - TensorFlow.js Machine Learning

## Description

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a single neuron linear regression model using TensorFlow.js. The goal of this model is to learn and predict outputs based on squared input values.

## Features

- **Data Generation and Processing**: Generates a series of inputs and squares them to create output data.
- **Tensor Manipulation:** Uses tensors to handle input and output data.
- **Data Normalization:** Implements a normalization function for the tensors.
- **Model Creation and Training:** Creates a single-layer neural network and trains it on the generated data.
- **Dynamic Learning Rate Adjustment:** Adjusts the learning rate during training for improved performance.
- **Evaluation and Prediction:** Evaluates the model's performance and makes predictions on new data.
